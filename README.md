Just an easy 50 points to get with inspect

Inspect by double-clicking and pressing inspect or click the 3 dots on top right and click inspect.
After inspecting, go to the Sources tab.
There should be 3 pages you can go to, each holding a part of the flag.
The first part will be in the first page, the second part will be in the third page, and the last part will be on the second page.
Putting them together results in a flag like this: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}
Just copy paste the parts in order into the flag checker on the picoCTF website and you'll get a free 50 points.
